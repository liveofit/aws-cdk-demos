# AWS - DEMOS AND EXTRAS

This repo is a compilation of many AWS isolated demos each of them has a little introduction and explanation of the architecture, resources, and services used.

If you are comfortable with AWS you could start directly with the high complexity demos, on the other hand, if you are starting with AWS, maybe you should start understanding the first demo and then continue step by step walking through the nexts.

## Requirements

Before we start we need to install AWS CLI, and after we should create IAM user with AdministratorAccess permissions in the AWS Console (IAM) and configure the user credentials in your computer using aws configure command.
For all demos, we are going to use TypeScript to provision cloud resources using CDK. Therefore make sure you have `NodeJS (>= 12)` installed on your computer as well. NodeJS installation is going to install the Node Package Manager(npm) which is needed to install CDK toolkit.
